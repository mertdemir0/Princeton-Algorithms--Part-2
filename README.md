Code for programming assignments in Algorithms part 2 by Princeton.  
All the material for the course is free and available online at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2/). It is best done as a progression to Algorithms Part 1 on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2/home/welcome)   
This course is significantly difficult than ALgorithms Part 1. It covers topics related to graphs, trees and tries in depth.  
The course consists of 5 programming assignments, each targetting a specific data structure or algorithm and it's real world application. To complete an assignment you require a score above 80% on automated tests.
